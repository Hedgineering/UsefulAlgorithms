A very useful reference is [William Fiset's algorithms repository](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/tree/master/src/main/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms). 

I plan to make this github repo as a variant of that where I program those algorithms in multiple languages I commonly use. As of now it's still in progress but I hope for this to be a resource for me and others in the future.
